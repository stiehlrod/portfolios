# Jennica Stiehl - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?
It was my intention to become more familiar with object oriented programming, problem-solving and the ruby language. All three of these objects have been accomplished.
What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?
The thing that caused the most struggle was finding the right mentor and spending all of my time on projects rather than practicing exercises and then realizing the error in that.
## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?
Enigma and Battleship were fun for me because in both we were building something and solving puzzles, which I enjoy. I did not enjoy Black Thursday because it had a lot going on and I knew there was a better way store and compare data.
What did you learn from your independent projects?
In the independent projects, I learned more about class interaction, command line, that not everything can be solved with conditionals.
What did you learn from your paired projects?
When in my group for Black Thursday, I realized that there is much more to learn and I improved my social skills and awareness.
## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?
As an SAB member I represented our module, helped organized events and brainstormed on community solutions.
What would you like to do to contribute next module?
Next module I will be busy with exercises.
